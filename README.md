    <h1>Wellcome to Accessabox</h1>
<p>
    The one and only script you will ever need for accessibility, its small, light and fast,
    requires little to no JavaScript knowledge to use, all you have to do is download the JS file and put it in your project folder, simple!
    h=this is a passion prject that I started when i left college 4 yearsw ago, life got really intense and i put it off for so long.

    <h2>What is Accessabox?</h2>
    Well to put it simple Accessabox is a JavaScript file containing accessibility tools for websites.
    A web developer can use to add accessibility to their site or clients site,
    it comes with pretty useful features, and it doesn't use a framework of any kind, speed is key right?

    <h2>Roadmap?</h2>
    <p>Well there isn't really a road map, though i know threre are some great things I'd like to add!
    its open source, please feel free, im working on an uncomplicated version so that even the most entry level web developer can look at the code and chop and change to their liking.
    im also going to be working on adding some new features to it such as better screen reading and some things ive learned from WebDev Simplified!
    thank you to all who look at this project and please again i say take this code and use it to your will!
    I believe every website should have user centered Accessibility!
