    <h1>Wellcome to Accessabox</h1>
<p>
    The one and only script you will ever need for accessibility, its small, light and fast,
    requires little to no JavaScript knowledge to use, all you have to do is download the JS file and put it in your project folder, simple!

    <h2>What is Accessabox?</h2>
    Well to put it simple Accessabox is a JavaScript file containing accessibility tools for websites.
    A web developer can use to add accessibility to their site or clients site,
    it comes with pretty useful features, and it doesn't use a framework of any kind, speed is key right?

    <h2>Why Accessabox?</h2>
    Well why not?
    We already copy and paste code and use stack overflow hahaha, why no use this toolbox to your advantage?
    It's here, and it's free, all you have to do is use it, it comes with a basic light and dark theme,
    with basic usable UI. a bonus is that I've written the code in such a way that you can customize
    The UI/UX to fit your websites needs.
    Accessabox is Plug&Play, no need to link the script file as it already does it automatically!
    (unless you want reference it from somewhere else, which you can do to ^_~)
